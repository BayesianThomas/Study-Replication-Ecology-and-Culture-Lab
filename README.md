Childhood Unpredictability and Moral Reasoning Replication

This repository contains analysis code and materials for our replication of Maranges et al. (2021), which proposed that unpredictable childhood environments reduce both deontological and utilitarian moral reasoning through empathy, trust, worldview, and relationship quality.

We tested this model in a large university sample. Contrary to the original findings, we found no main effect of childhood unpredictability on moral reasoning outcomes. These results motivate a broader replication across six cross-cultural samples to further evaluate links between behavioral ecology and moral judgment.
